# 1.0 Hardware & Operating System
## 1.0 Introduction
The major tech companies, such as Google, Samsung, Apple, and Microsoft, collect vast amounts of personal data. Anyone who is concerned about privacy and security is already aware of this issue. The problem arises when users are stuck with insecure operating systems that force them to use pre-installed apps, which cannot be deleted. This situation allows these companies to profit from the data generated by the apps that users are compelled to use.

Apple, Google, and Facebook collect extensive data from their applications, profiling your information and selling it to third-party companies, which may even include government agencies. This issue extends beyond the **United States**; it also has implications in the **European Union**. While the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** in the EU aims to protect some user data from being sold, companies like Meta have found ways to circumvent these regulations. By transferring the data of **EU citizens** to servers located in the **United States**, where the legal framework is less stringent, they can exploit loopholes to sell your data.

## 1.2 Choosing the right phone & operating system
The [Google Tensor Security Core and Titan M2 chips](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/10/pixel-6-setting-new-standard-for-mobile.html?ref=devilreef.net) is a separate, physical, tamper-resistant components designed to securely store your sensitive data, such as encryption keys, PINs and passwords. Isolated from the main processor, these chips operate on their own minimal and hardened operating system, which makes unauthorized access nearly impossible, even if the Android OS itself is compromised. Additionally, another key advantages of choosing a Pixel Phone over other Android devices is the long-term commitment to security updates. Every recent Pixel model guarantees a minimum of seven years of security updates. For more information about how many years the security update are guarantee by Google on a specific model you can visit this page [Google Pixel Phone LifeTime](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro).

The second step is to select an operating system. There are numerous options available, but if you prioritize security and privacy, GrapheneOS is a top choice. It offers a wide range of security and privacy features (e.g. Google Play Services sandboxed). For more information about the features [here](https://grapheneos.org/features).

## 1.3 Installing GrapheneOS
In this guide, I cover only the installation and configuration of the operating system GrapheneOS because it is currently considered the best operating system related to security and privacy.
Before you begin the installation process, please verify that your Pixel phone model is supported by checking the list [here](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices).
The official GrapheneOS website offers a comprehensive guide for installing the operating system on your Pixel phone.  
  
You can choose between using the **Web Installer(easy way)** or executing **CLI commands(hard way)**:

- [Web Installer](https://grapheneos.org/install/web)
- [CLI Install](https://grapheneos.org/install/cli)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After the installation of GrapheneOS ensure your bootloader is locked.  
> **|- Settings ➜ System ➜ Developer Options ➜ OEM unlocking ➜ [OFF]**

# 2.0 System settings (GrapheneOS)
All the settings I cover up are accessible on the app **'Settings'** of the GrapheneOS operating system. These settings are based only on my threat model and meet a high security and privacy level, feel free to copy or change them based on your preferences. I don't cover personal aspects such as the theme of the keyboard or night light mode.

  <summary>More information:</summary>

  > Using a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a good practice nowadays. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** can reduce some risks (e.g. **Man-in-the-middle/eavesdropping**) the downside is you need to trust the **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** provider. Using a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** prevents your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** reading your traffic. For almost two years, I have continued to use the **Mullvad VPN** because it meets my security and privacy standards. Obviously, do some research and choose a **Virtual Private Networks (VPN)** that meets your threat model.

# 3.0 Threat models
The most useful feature of GrapheneOS is the user profile feature (multiple users). Each user profile have its own unique key that is utilized for encrypting and decrypting the data associated with that user profile. The filesystem-based encryption is designed to allow the user profile to be deleted without requiring the keys, enabling the owner profile to delete other profiles even when they are not active. Additionally, GrapheneOS has introduced the **'end session'** feature for user profiles, accessible through the menu power, this feature enables users to put the data of a specific profile at rest. In contrast, on Android 16 AOSP, the user are not be able to put the data in a rest state until the device is shut down or rebooted. For more information [here](https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption).  

In this chapter, I describe the two most used threat models.
## 3.1 Only-one user
This threat model is designed to utilize a single user profile known as the **'Owner'** profile. The **'Owner'** profile is automatically created during the initial setup of the phone, requiring no additional actions from the user. As illustrated in the image below, this model involves installing and using all applications within the **'Owner'** profile, while leveraging the sandboxed environment of **Google Play Services** provided by the GrapheneOS.  
<img width="761" height="521" alt="Only-One" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2890d9ca-a336-4383-b842-441541e21bb2" />

## 3.2 Multiple users
This threat model is designed to operate with **multiple user profiles**, which must be created through ***[Settings -> System -> Multiple users -> Add user]***. As shown in the image below, the **'Owner'** profile is designated solely for installing and updating applications from the **Google Play Store** or other **app stores**. After installing the desired applications, you should disable the application in the **'Owner'** profile and utilize the **'Install available apps'** feature located in ***[Settings -> System -> Multiple users -> (Select the desired profile) -> Install available apps]*** to push the applications to the other profiles. This approach minimizes the attack vector for the **'Owner'** profile, as it will not be used by the user, with the main applications residing in other profiles(e.g. **'Personal'**). Consequently, if one of the user profiles is compromised, malware will not be able to spread to the other profiles.     
<img width="1276" height="942" alt="Multiple-users drawio" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfdacf14-3042-4027-abef-65791c755e1b" />

# 4.0 Software
If you want to reduce the attack surface and data collection, you should install only the applications you really needs it. Reduce the permissions of applications to the minimum of necessary.
Here are some valuable features that can help minimize the attack surface and limit data collection:
- [Sensors permission](https://grapheneos.org/features#sensors-permission-toggle)
- [Network permission](https://grapheneos.org/features#network-permission-toggle)
- [Contact scopes](https://grapheneos.org/features#contact-scopes)
- [Storage scopes](https://grapheneos.org/features#storage-scopes)
- [Exploit mitigation](https://grapheneos.org/features#exploit-mitigations)

> [!NOTE]
> The list of apps below is ranked from most recommended to least recommended. While some of these apps are not FOSS and may raise privacy concerns (e.g., Google Play Store), they are placed at the top due to the alternative privacy-focused options (e.g., Aurora Store) having known security issues that discourage their use.
